#**Running Objects**
__Running Objects__ is a framework that allows you to use simple OO concepts, focus on your business domain and do not waste time with areas that are not relevant to your application. You will build better software, with less time and with no pain.

It's built on top of __ASP.NET MVC__ using a refined mix of concepts such as __Domain-Driven Design__, __Naked Objects__, __Object-Oriented UI__ and __Design Patterns__. Basically, everything that is necessary to let you aggregate the highest business value in the shortest time to your application.
