#**Running Objects**
__Running Objects__ is a framework that allows you to use simple OO concepts, focus on your business domain and do not waste time with areas that are not relevant to your application. You will build better software, with less time and with no pain.

It's built on top of __ASP.NET MVC__ using a refined mix of concepts such as __Domain-Driven Design__, __Naked Objects__, __Object-Oriented UI__ and __Design Patterns__. Basically, everything that is necessary to let you aggregate the highest business value in the shortest time to your application.

#**Features**

----------

###Domain-Driven Design & Pure Object-Oriented Modeling

Use the power of DDD and OO to develop your applications. Your OO design
and model will be your application. You don’t need to worry with
developing Data Access Components and/or User Interface code. Keep the
focus in your business requirements.

----------

###Unit Test by Nature

Making use of OO concepts, **Running Objects** let you create a clean
code, ready for unit testing. You can ask "*But do I need to do
something else to create the unit tests?*“, we will answer”*Yes, the
unit tests!*".

----------

###RESTful Services

Expose your objects as REST services automatically. **Running Objects**
follows the HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) REST
constraint to generate the RESTful service layer of your objects.

----------

###Fluent Security API

No more hassles configuring security of your application. Use the code
based configuration to create high-coherent security settings. You will
never have an out of date security configuration again!

----------

###Customizable UI

**Running Objects** provides a default set of views that automatically
generates the user interface based on your objects. But if you want to
customize them, feel free to take the control and create your own views,
templates and mix them all!

----------

###Transparent Persistence

Using the Repository Pattern, **Running Objects** let you use the
persistence you want! It has an Entity Framework Repository ready to
use, so if you are using Entity Framework, it will be just 1 line of
configuration to use it!
