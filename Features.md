##Domain-Driven Design & Pure Object-Oriented Modeling
Use the power of DDD and OO to develop your applications. Your OO design and model will be your application. You don't need to worry with developing Data Access Components and/or User Interface code. Keep the focus in your business requirements.

##Unit Test by Nature
Making use of OO concepts, __Running Objects__ let you create a clea code for unit testing. You can ask "*But do I need to do something else to create the unit tests?*", we will answer "*Yes, the unit tests!*".

##RESTful Services
Expose your objects as REST services automatically. __Running Objects__ follows the HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) REST constraint to generate the RESTful service layer of your objects.

##Fluent Security API
No more hassles configuring security of your application. Use the code based configuration to create high-coherent security settings. You will never have an out of date security configuration again!

##Custom UI 
__Running Objects__ provides a default set of views that automatically generates the user interface based on your objects. But if you want to customize them, feel free to take the control and create your own views, templates and mix them all!

##Transparent Persistence
Using the Repository Pattern, __Running Objects__ let you use the persistence you want! It has an Entity Framework Repository ready to use, so if you are using Entity Framework, it will be just 1 line of configuration to use it!
